This is a simple python script that can convert two CSV tables to a GedcomX json file.

# Basic usage

_Example:_
```shell
# print result to stdout
main.py persons.csv families.csv
# put result in new file named output.json
main.py persons.csv families.csv --output output.json
```

Replace the file names with your own. 

# Structure of the CSV files

Notes:
- The ID `0` is reservedÔ∏è for the unknown person. It can be used in families with unknown partners. Anything specified for that ID will be ignored.
- IDs can be any string (except for `0`). They are directly used in the resulting GedcomX file
- `full_name` is the name the person normally is called
- `gender` can be `Male`, `Female`, `Unknown` or `Intersex`
- dates are formatted as specified [here](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/date-format-specification.md)
- `child_of` specifies the family id that this person is a child of. It must be included in the family table
- `notes` are seperated by semicolon

## Family table

| id  | partner1 | partner2 | date     | place  | notes                                               |
|-----|----------|----------|----------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 0   | 1        | 0        | +1940-04 | Brolin | family of Kim                                       |
| 1   | 2        | 0        | +1920    |        | since partner2 is 0, a new person will be generated |

- `ID` can be any string, `0` is not reserved
- `partner1` and `partner2` are IDs of persons specified in the person table
- `date` is the date of the marriage, `place` is the place of the marriage
- `notes` are seperated by semicolon
